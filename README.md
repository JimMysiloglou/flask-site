# Flask Site
My personal site created with python Flask microframework featuring blog and portfolio sections.

I intent to deploy the site on Heroku platform.

Some of the modules I used for the creation are:
- Flask-Admin 
- Flask-Login
- Flask-Babel *for dual language support (english, greek)*
- Flask-CKEditor *for advanced text editing*
- Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Flask-WTF
